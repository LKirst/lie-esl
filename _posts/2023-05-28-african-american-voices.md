If textbooks and curricula about US cultural studies did not explicitly require
learners to read texts by and listen to an ethnically diverse cast of voices,
it would be likely that learners of English would miss out on important
perspectives on cultural studies.

In the industries behind many American films and texts students of English
study, Black people are underrepresented. The proportion of Black directors,
writers and producers in film and TV in the US falls well below of their
representation in the overall US population. Black people are also
underrepresented in journalism and in the publishing industry.

To ensure students get a more complete picture of US cultural studies, teachers
and textbooks actively encourage students to study narratives written by Black
writers and featuring Black protagonists and to learn about inspiring Black
people who are have shaped or are shaping American culture. Four examples of
African-Americans who have left their mark on American culture are Alice
Walker, Toni Morison, Marley Dias, and Spike Lee.

Spike Lee (born 1957) is an American filmmaker and actor. His films, both
fictional films and documentaries, deal with controversial subject matters. 

Spike Lee does not shy away from conversations about race. Many of his films
feature race relations as their main topic, for example _Do the right thing_
(1989), _Malcom X_ (1992), _BlacKkKlansman_ (2018). He is also been a champion
of diversity in Hollywood. He has been advocating for more representation of
people of colour, for example with his satire _Bamboozled_ or by criticising
productions for a lack of diversity. Spike Lee has repeatedly faced criticism
for bringing those controversial issues to the screen, but it does not seem to
discourage him.

Many of Spike Lee's films are deeply political. Two examples are the
documentaries _When the leaves broke_ (2006) about the US government's failings
in the response to Hurricane Katrina, and the documentary _NYC Epicenters
9/11-2021 1/2_. With the stories his films tell, Spike Lee draws attention to
the need for change.

Alice Walker (born 1944) is a writer, poet and activist. She became the first
African American woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction, for the novel
_The Color Purple_ (1982), which was turned into a movie and a Broadway
musical.

Walker was the eigth daughter of sharecroppers, which meant that her parents
farmed land which belonged to somebody else in exchange for living there. When
she was blinded on one eye in an accident, her mother encouraged her to write
instead of doing chores in the house. A scholarship made it possible for her to
attend college.

After her graduation in the mid-60s, Walker joined the civil rights movement in
Mississippi. During this time, she was at the forefront of social change. For
example, she and her then-husband became the only interracial couple in
Mississippi. She also taught one of the first women's study course at a
college. And she took part in the March on Washington, during which Martin
Luther King Jr. held his famous _I Have a Dream_ speech. 

In her profile of Walker, S. Dunning writes: "Walker is such a prolific writer
that it would be impossible to discuss all of her work; she has written in
almost every form and genre." Reuccuring themes are African-American
experiences, racism and sexism. Walker sees a link between gender oppression
and race oppresion and coins the term "womanist" for the politics which unite
the ideas of gender and race liberation.

Tony Morrison (born 1931, died 2019) was a writer, editor, and teacher, and the
first African American woman to win the Nobel prize for literature in 1993.

Growing up, Morrison heard many stories, songs and folktales from her parents
who taught her about Black culture. After her master's degree she taught at
Texas Southern University and Howard University, two historically black
universities. In 1965, started to work for Random House as a fiction editor.
She started writing her own novels when she noticed as a publisher that there
were few novels who spoke to readers as herself.

Morrison's most famous novel is _Beloved_ (1987), for which she won a Pulitzer
Prize. It is about a runaway slave who kills her daughter when they are
caught to spare her a life of slavery. Lyn Innes writes in The Guardian:

> The mother and those who live with her are haunted by the memory of the dead
> child, and the novel is also a more general representation of the terrible
> history that continues to haunt African Americans, a history that must be
> confronted in all its anguish before black people can learn to love
> themselves and one another.

The plot is based on a factual incident which Morrison uncovered. The book was
turned into a film, starring Opra Winfrey as the protagonist. Morrison later
also wrote the libretto[^libretto] for the opera _Margret Garner_ (2005) about
the incident that inspired _Beloved_.

## Marley Dias

Marley Dias (born 2005) loves reading, but she was disappointed by how many
books were about white boys and their dogs. To change that, she founded the
#1000BlackGirlBooks challenge on Twitter in 2015, at the young age of 11. Her
goal was to collect 1,000 books with a Black female protagonist and sent them
to the school in Jamaica her mother had attended. The challenge went viral and
numerous organizations and individuals helped her with the project. To-date,
Marley has collected over 13,000 books.

In a Guardian interview with Coco Khan, Marley Dias explains that she sees her
role in "motivat\[ing\] young girls, regardless of their race or their
experience, to get out there and do the things you love and that will help
other people." She has writen the book _Marley Dias gets it done: And so can
you!_ to encourages young girls to read and to become activists for things they
are passionate about. She sees activism as a way out of pessimism: "All we ever
hear is bad news; we’re put into a fear-mongering world where we’re told that
things are bad, that bad things are always happening and the world’s going to
end in 2050. And we don’t see [enough of] the good people like Greta, or the
[organisers of] March for Our Lives, and we don’t see people like me." Dias
hopes the story of people people fighting for a better world will inspire
people to do the same and become more optimistic about the future.
