## What is Zotero

When you write a scientific paper or prepare a scientific presentation, you will
have to quote your sources to avoid plagiarism. There are different citation
styles, each with slightly different rules on how to quote your sources. Your
supervisor will tell you which style to follow.

The rules for correct citations can sometimes be confusing, and it can be
difficult to keep track of all sources you cite in your text. For that reason,
I recommend using a reference management software. In this tutorial, I will
introduce you to the free and open source reference management software Zotero. 

## Installation

You can install Zotero on Mac, Windows, Linux and iOS:
<https://www.zotero.org/download/>

Be sure to not just install Zotero itself but also the Zotero Connector
extension for your browser.

When you start Zotero the first time, Zotero should install a plugin for your
word processor (Microsoft Office Word, LibreOffice Writer, or Goolge Docs).
Open your word processor to check if you can now see the Zotero toolbar.
