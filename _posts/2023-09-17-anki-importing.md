## Importing notes

You can import cards others send you as an *apkg* file:

1. In Anki, go to *File* > *Import*

2. In the new window, find the *apkg* file you want to import. Select it, and
   then click on *Open*.

3. Anki will tell you what notes it has just imported. You can close the window
   with the list of notes.

## Browsing notes

1. Open the browser window, by clicking on *Browse* in the main window.

2. At the top, you can toggle whether you want to see *Cards* or *Notes*.

2. The sidebar allows you to filter your cards (for example by deck or by tag).

3. If you click on a card, you can edit it.
