## Verb forms

The third conditional has two parts, just as the first and the second
conditional: The if clause describes a condition. The main clause (= _der
Hauptsatz_) describes a result of the condition.

The if clause can come before or after the main clause.
{: .notice--warning}

In the if clause, use the **past perfect**: _had_ + past participle

In the main clause, use the **conditional perfect**: _would / could_ + _have_ +
past participle

As a rule of thumb, remember that we don't use _would_ in the if clause.
{: .notice--warning}

Examples:

- _If I **had known** you would come, I **would have baked** a cake._

- _I **would have studied** more yesterday if I **hadn't had** a headache._

## Meaning

The if clause of a third conditional type sentence describes an **impossible
condition in the past**. It is impossible because the past was different from
what the condition imagines.

The main clause describes an imagined **result in the past**.
