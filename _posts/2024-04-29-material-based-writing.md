with your teacher if they agree with the answers below.

## What is the structure of a material-based writing assignment?

Your text should always follow the same structure:

1. Introduction, which leads up to and ends in a paraphrase of the essay
   question
2. Main body, in which you present two to three arguments or views to answer
   the question
3. Concluding paragraph, in which you sum up the main points and present your
   personal opinion or draw a conclusion

## Should I reference the sources?

Do not reference the sources of the material in the material-based writing
(MBW) assignment and do not quote the sources directly.

There is one exception to this rule: If one material is a short
quotation, you may use it as a hook in your introduction. In this
case, you should reference the person you quote and explain the
quote briefly.

## How can I tell if I have used a material "enough"?

If a material contains several numbers, do not just pick out one. Make sure you
use the material in a way that shows you have understood the relationships or
developments it presents.

If a material presents several facts, make sure that you do not just focus on
one piece of information. If the material is in English, paraphrase where
possible.

## How many arguments should I write?

I recommend using one of the three materials for the introduction and the
remaining two for two body paragraphs.

You can also have three body paragraphs. You may, for example, feel more
comfortable using each material in a body paragraph of its own. If you use one
material in the introduction and the other two materials for two body
paragraphs, you can also add a third body paragraph with an argument based on
your own ideas. Just remember that I expect you to have a topic sentence and
enough supporting sentences for every body paragraph to explain the argument
the topic sentence makes.

## What is the difference between "comment" and "discuss"?

*Discuss* means you have to argue for and against an argument, or write
about the advantages and disadvantages of a given context. *Comment* often
means you should argue in one direction. However, if the material lends itself
more to presenting two different views on an issue, you can treat a comment
task in the same way as a discussion task.

Sometimes, the task contains neither *comment* nor *discuss* and just says
"write a composition". The task is the same as if one of the instruction words
were present: Write a 300-word essay to answer the question the essay prompt
asks.

Pay attention to all parts of the essay prompt, not just the instruction word.
Sometimes the prompt will tell you explicitly that you are expected to discuss
"opportunities and downsides" or "benefits and drawbacks" of an issue or that
you have to write about "possible solutions" to a problem. The use of the
plural in "opportunitie**s** and downside**s**" and similar phrases does not
mean, however, that you have to write about multiple opportunities and multiple
drawbacks. One of each will be enough.

## Will I lose credits for writing too much or too little?

If you write more than 300 words, this will not negatively affect your grade.
However, you may lose credits if you go below the minimum word count of 300.

## How long should each part of my text be?

If you have two body paragraphs, your second body paragraph should present the
view you agree with more, if you write about two different views, or the
stronger of your two arguments.

The word counts below are only recommendations:

| paragraph             | words |
|-----------------------|-------|
| introduction          | ~ 50  |
| first body paragraph  | ~ 90  |
| second body paragraph | ~ 110 |
| conclusion            | ~ 50  |

## What register should I use?

You are expected to use a semi-formal to formal register. This means that you
should:

- Avoid contractions (e.g. *they've =\> they have; won't =\> will not; isn't
  =\> is not; it's =\> it is*) 
- Avoid slang and colloquialisms (*it's gonna* =\> it will / it is going to;
  kid =\> child*, *guys =\> men*)
