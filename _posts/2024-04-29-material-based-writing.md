## Should I reference the sources?

Do not reference the sources of the material in the Material Based Writing
(MBW) assignment and do not quote the sources directly.

There is one exception to this rule: If one resource is a short quotation, you
may use it as a hook in your introduction. In this case, you should reference
the person you quote.

## How can I tell if I have used a resource "enough"?

If a resource contains several numbers, do not just pick out one. Make sure you
use the resource in a way that shows you have understood the relationships or
developments it presents.

If a resource presents several facts, make sure that you do not just focus on
one piece of information. If the resource is in English, paraphrase where
possible.

## How many arguments should I write?

I recommend using one of the three resources for the introduction and the
remaining two for two body paragraphs.

If for some reason you feel more comfortable using each resource in a body
paragraph of its own, you can divide your main body into three paragraphs as
well. Just remember that I expect you to have a topic sentence and supporting
sentences for every body paragraph.

## What is the difference between "comment" and "discuss"?

In the Fachabitur, there is no significant difference between those two
instruction words. Sometimes, the task does not contain either of them and just
says "write a composition". The task is always to write a 300-word essay to
answer the question the essay prompt asks.

"Discuss ..." means you have to argue for and against an argument, or write
about the advantages and disadvantages of a given context. "Comment ..." often
means you should argue in one direction. However, if the material lends itself
more to presenting two different views on an issue, you can treat a comment
task in the same way as a discussion task.

Pay attention to all parts of the essay prompt, not just the instruction word.
Sometimes the prompt will tell you explicitly that you are expected to discuss
"opportunities and downsides" / "benefits and drawbacks" of an issue or that
you have to present "possible solutions" to a problem.

## Will I lose credits for writing too much or too little?

If you write more than 300 words, this will not negatively affect your grade.
However, you may lose credits if you go below the minimum word count of 300.

## How long should each part of my introduction be?

If you have two body paragraphs, your second body paragraph should present the
view you agree with more, if you write about two different views, or the
stronger of your two arguments.

The word counts below are only recommendations:

| paragraph             | words |
|-----------------------|-------|
| introduction          | ~ 50  |
| first body paragraph  | ~ 90  |
| second body paragraph | ~ 110 |
| conclusion            | ~ 50  |
