## What is the difference?

A mistake learners of English often make is to confuse _than_ and _then_.

### Than

In most cases, _than_ is a conjunction. As a conjunction, _than_ comes before
the second part of an unequal comparison (= _vor dem zweiten Teil in einem
Vergleich zweier ungleicher Dinge_). PONS suggests the mnemonic device:
_th**a**n mit a wird mit **a**ls Ã¼bersetzt_.

> Imogen can run faster than Sean.

_Than_ also comes in phrases after terms like _other_ and _rather_ before a
less preferred option in a choice (= _vor der weniger bevorzugten Option in
einer Wahl_):

> I'd rather read a book than watch a film.

### Then

_Then_ is an adverb in most contexts. We use it to refer to a point in time or
to show the order of a sequence of events.

> I'll first do my English homework, then Maths, and then French.

_Then_ can also mean 'in that case':

> You have a cat, don't you? Do you have to go to the vet often, then?

There are other functions of _than_ and _then_ but if you know the rules above,
you can avoid most mistakes.
