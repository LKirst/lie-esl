## Common phrases for presenting your opinion

- In my (honest) opinion, ...

- I (really) think that ...

- I (strongly) believe that ...

- I (truly) feel that ...

- I'm sure that ...

Common mistake: You cannot use the English verb _to mean_ (German _bedeuten_)
as a translation of German _meinen_ (English _to think / to be of the opinion
that_). The English noun _meaning_ (German _Bedeutung_) is not the same as
German _Meinung_ (English _opinion_).

## Semi-formal to formal phrases you can use for more variation

Phrases to use if you are sure of your opinion

- Without a doubt, ...

- I'm (fairly) confident that ...

Phrases which show that you know that there may be other perspectives

- From my point of view, ...

- From my perspective, ...

## Exercise

A great way to practice expressing opinion are _Would you rather_ questions.
Ask a friend to discuss one of the following questions with you and try to use
three to five new phrases you have learned:

- Would your rather be the smartest or the fastest person in the world?

- Would you rather live somewhere where it is only summer all year long or live
  where it is constantly winter?

- Would you rather move to the UK or to the US?

- Would you rather have tea with King Charles or with the President of the USA?
