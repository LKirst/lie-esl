Common phrases:

- In my (honest) opinion, ...

- I (really) think that ...

- I (strongly) believe that ...

- I (truly) feel that ...

- I'm sure that ...

Common mistake: You cannot use the English verb _to mean_ (German _bedeuten_)
as a translation of German _meinen_ (English _to think / to be of the opinion
that_). The English noun _meaning_ (German _Bedeutung_) is not the same as
German _Meinung_ (English _opinion_).
{: .notice--warning}

Semi-formal to formal phrases:

- It seems to me that ...

- I'm fairly confident that ...

- From my point of view ...

- From my perspective ...

- Without a doubt, ...

- I'm entirely / quite convinced ...
