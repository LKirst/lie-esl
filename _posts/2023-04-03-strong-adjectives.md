## What are extreme adjectives

Extreme adjectives (sometimes called strong adjectives) are adjectives with
which we do not use _very_ because they in themselves already have the meaning
of _very_.

Here are some examples:

| very + adjective | extreme adjectives                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| very big         | enormous, huge, vast                                      |
| very small       | tiny                                                      |
| very clever      | brilliant                                                 |
| very bad         | awful, terrible, disgusting, dreadful                     |
| very sure        | certain                                                   |
| very good        | excellent, perfect, ideal, splendid, wonderful, fantastic |
| very tasty       | delicious                                                 |
| very ugly        | hideous                                                   |
| very funny       | hilarious                                                 |
| very scared      | terrified                                                 |
| very tired       | exhausted                                                 |

| very pleased     | over the moon, floating on air                            |

## When to use extreme adjectives

Strong adjectives can make your writing more interesting. 

Use them when you have to persuade a reader in your writing assignment, when an
assignment calls for your opinion, or when you want to show a strong feeling in
a creative writing assignment.

## Exercise

Rewrite the following sentences with extreme adjectives.

_We went to a football match last weekend. Even though it was very cold, we had
a very good time. At half-time we had a very tasty pork pie and my father
ordered something very bad to drink: Beef tea. He said he enjoyed it, but I
took just a very small sip and I instantly knew he was lying._
