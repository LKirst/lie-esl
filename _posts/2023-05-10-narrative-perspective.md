Any story is told through a narrative perspective. The author of a story
chooses a narrative perspective to produce a certain effect.

## What is narrative perspective?

We can differentiate between three commonly used types of narrative perspective
which are different in how much the narrator knows and how they are involved in
the story:

| narrative perspective   | definition                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| first person            | The narrator uses first person pronouns (_I_, _my_, _me_, _we_, _us_, _our_). The narrator is a character in the story.                      |
| third person limited    | The narrator is not a character in the story and talks about the characters in the third person. The perspective of the narrator is limited. |
| third person omniscient | The narrator is not a character in the story and talks about the characters in the third person. The narrator is all knowing.                |

## Effects of narrative perspective

When you analyse the narrative perspective, you should also ask the question,
what effect the perspective has and what relation the reader has to the
narrator. The following questions may help you:

- Is the narrator reliable?

- How limited is the narrator's kowledge?

- How does the narrator present the (world of the) narrative?

- How does the reader feel about the narrator?
