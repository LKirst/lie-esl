## What is narrative perspective?

Any story is told through a narrative perspective. The author of a story
chooses a narrative perspective to produce a certain effect.

We can differentiate between three commonly used types of narrative perspective
which are different in how much the narrator knows and how they are involved in
the story:

| narrative perspective   | definition                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| first person            | The narrator uses first person pronouns (_I_, _my_, _me_, _we_, _us_, _our_). The narrator is a character in the story.                      |
| third person limited    | The narrator is not a character in the story and talks about the characters in the third person. The perspective of the narrator is limited. |
| third person omniscient | The narrator is not a character in the story and talks about the characters in the third person. The narrator is all knowing.                |
