## Quotations

German learners of English often use German quotation marks with the opening
quotation mark below (= _Anführungszeichen unten_).

In English, both opening and closing quotation marks go above (=
_Anführungszeichen zu Beginn des Zitats und zum Ende sind oben_). British
English uses single quotations marks for quotations and dialogue. For a
quotation inside a quotation, British English uses double quotation marks.

> He asked, 'Did you find a mistake?' I told him, 'Remember what Mr Liebermann
> always says, "Don't forget the third person singular -s!"'

American English uses double quotation marks for quotations or dialogue. If
there is a quotation within a quotation, American English uses single quotation
marks.

> He asked, "Did you find a mistake?" I told him, "Remember what Mr Liebermann
> always says, 'Don't forget the third person singular -s!'"

## Titles of books or films

English (unlike German) does not use quotation marks for titles of books or
films or names of newspapers. In English you underline those titles (or use
_italics_, but that is difficult in handwriting).

> Do you know the fairy tale <u>Jack and the Beanstalk</u>?
