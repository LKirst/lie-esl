Anki lets you chose the number of cards you want to learn every day. Here is
how you do that on the desktop/laptop:

1. Click on the cogwheel[^cogwheel] symbol next to one of your decks in the
   *Decks* menu.

2. Go to *Options*. In the window which opens, you can change the settings for
   all decks, the present deck or for the duration of one day only.

3. *New cards/day* is the number of cards you have never seen before that Anki
   will ask you to learn every day (if there are new cards left). I recommend
   10-20 new cards per day. (Remember that one note with the cards *front >
   back* and the card *back > front* will count as **two** cards.)

4. *Maximum reviews/day* is the maximum number of cards you will review every
   day. I recommend at least 100-200 cards per day. If you have decided that
   you will study 10 new cards per day and a total of 100 cards, 90 cards will
   be cards you already know, and which will not take up much time.

[^cogwheel]:  a wheel with a series of teeth on the edge that fit between the teeth on the next wheel and cause it to move
