## When to use the singular "they"

If you do not know the gender of a person you refer to, when the gender is
irrelevant, or when somebody identifies as nonbinary, use "they" instead of
"she" or "he".

The use of *they* for referents whose gender we do not know or whose gender is
unimportant dates back centuries. Here are some examples from the Cambridge
Dictionary ELT blog:

- Everyone needs to bring *their* laptop to class tomorrow.
- I didn’t see the person who stole my wallet. *They* reached into backpack and
  ran away.
- The teacher should expect students to contact *them* with questions after
  class.

The use of *they* as a person's self-identified pronoun is a more recent
development. 

- Casey is a gender-fluid person. *They* are from Texas and enjoy tacos.

## How to use the singular "they" in a sentence

We use forms of the singular *they* with a plural form of the verb. The APA
style guide says that both *themselves* and *themself* are acceptable as
singular pronouns, but *themselves* is more common.

Below you can find examples from the APA style and grammar guidelines for all
forms of the singular *they*. Fill out the gaps and then check the answer key.

1. Each child played with \_\_\_\_ parent.

2. The cup of coffee is \_\_\_\_.

3. Casey is a gender-fluid person. \_\_\_\_ are from Texas and enjoy tacos.
