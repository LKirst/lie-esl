# Cartoons

When you are preparing for an exam in which you will be asked to analyse a
cartoon, it will pay off to make sure you recognize politicians who are often
in the news. Make it a habit to regularly look at different cartoons and
identify the issues they allude to.

If you need help with a cartoon, you can always write to your teacher and ask
them to point you in the right direction.

## Stylistic devices

When you interpret a cartoon you should identify the stylistic devices the
cartoonist uses to portray a message. Examples for stylistic devices are:

- hyperbole or exaggeration: The cartoon overdoes a physical characteristic of people or things to make a point.

- metaphor: The cartoon uses a word, phrase or image for another thing in order to emphasise their similar qualities.

- irony: There is a contrast between how things are or what the cartoon says on a surface level and the way you expect them to be or what the message of the cartoon really means. 

- symbol: A concrete object stands for an abstract idea (e.g. a dove symbolizes peace).  

- pun: The cartoon makes a play on words to make a point.
