# Cartoons

When you are preparing for an exam in which you will be asked to analyse a
cartoon, it will pay off to make sure you recognize politicians who are often
in the news. Make it a habit to regularly look at different cartoons and
identify the issues they allude to.

If you need help with a cartoon, you can always write to your teacher and ask
them to point you in the right direction.

Here are three links to online newspapers without a paywall which publish cartoons:
