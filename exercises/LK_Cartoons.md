# Political cartoons

When you are preparing for an exam in which you will be asked to analyse a
cartoon, it will pay off to make sure you recognize politicians who are often
in the news. Make it a habit to regularly look at different cartoons and
identify the issues they allude to.

If you need help with a cartoon, you can always write to your teacher and ask
them to point you in the right direction.

## Free resources

Here are three links to online newspapers without a paywall which publish cartoons:

- Mainly British politics: <https://www.theguardian.com/cartoons/archive>

## Stylistic devices

When you interpret a cartoon you should identify the stylistic devices the
cartoonist uses to portray a message. Examples for stylistic devices are:

- hyperbole or exaggeration: The cartoon overdoes a physical characteristic of people or things to make a point.

- metaphor: The cartoon uses a word, phrase or image for another thing in order to emphasise their similar qualities.

- irony: There is a contrast between how things are or what the cartoon says on a surface level and the way you expect them to be or what the message of the cartoon really means. 

- symbol: A concrete object stands for an abstract idea (e.g. a dove symbolizes peace).  

- pun: The cartoon makes a play on words to make a point.

- analogy: The cartoon compares two unlike things (situations, people, actions, ...) to highlight a resemblance of a particular aspect.

## Exercise

1. Take about 10 minutes to familiarize yourself with the current news stories
using one of the online news websites which Mr Liebermann recommends.

2. Browse one (or several) of the websites for political cartoons listed above.

    - Try to recognize the news stories you have learnt about in step 1 in the cartoons you see. 

    - Pick a cartoon which you think you understand based on your research and write a cartoon analysis.
    Make sure to explain **how** the cartoonist makes a point (see the stylistic devices listed above).
