# Checklist: Cartoon analysis (B1, v1.0.0)

## Language (60%)

- You use the **first person** and **different verbs and phrases to express
your opinion** in the **last paragraph** where you comment on the cartoon. In
the rest of the comment you **avoid first-person pronouns** to focus on an
objective analysis.

- You use a wide range of **sentence structures correctly**, e.g.
conditional sentences, relative clauses, and subordinate clauses.

- You show a good command of a **broad lexical repertoire**. You can
vary[^1] formulation to avoid frequent repetition[^2] and you find
**paraphrases** when you do not know a word you need. You use your own words to
explain what captions and speech or thought bubbles mean. You make few spelling
mistakes.

- You use the **correct tenses**. Use the **present progressive** to
describe **actions** depicted in the cartoon. Use the **present simple** to
describe the setting.

- You connect ideas with **different linking / transition words**,
including different subordinating conjunctions (e.g. *although, wherever, so
that, \...*) and adverbial conjunctions (e.g. *however, nevertheless,
meanwhile, \...*).

- You use the formal register. You do **not use contractions** (*they've
=\> they have; won't =\> will not; isn't =\> is not*) and you use **no slang or
colloquialisms**.
