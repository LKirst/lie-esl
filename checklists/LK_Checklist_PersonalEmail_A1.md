# Checklist: Personal Email (A1, v1.2.0)

- [ ] Has your email got a **subject line** (= _einen Betreff_), which summarizes the content of the email (= _der den Inhalt deiner Mail zusammenfasst_)?\
      _subject: XYZ_

- [ ] Has the email got a **greeting** (= _eine Begrüßung_), followed by a name and a comma (= _gefolgt von einem Namen und einem Komma_)? 
  
     - _Hi Jane,_
     - _Hello (again) Joe,_

- [ ] Skip a line (_= überspringe eine Zeile_) after the greeting.

- [ ] Spelling:
  
     - [ ] Does the first line of the email start with a **capital letter** (= Großbuchstabe)
  
     - [ ] Do all sentences start with a capital letter?
  
     - [ ] Do all names of people, places, days and months start with a capital letter?
  
     - [ ] Did you write the word "I" with a capital letter?

- [ ] Do you have an **introduction** (= _Einleitung_)? For your introduction, you can \...
  
     - thank your friend for his or her email: _Thanks for your email. It’s great to hear from you. = Danke für deine E-Mail. Es ist schön, von dir zu hören._
     - ask your friend how he or she is and tell him or her how you are: _How are you? I’m fine. = Wie geht es dir. Mir geht es gut._

- [ ] Does the email **answer all questions** you were asked? (= _Beantwortet die Mail alle Fragen, die dir gestellt wurden?_)

- [ ] Do you end your email with a **question** (_What's ...? Have you got ...? Are you ...?_) and some **friendly words?**
  
     - _I can’t wait to hear from you. = Ich kann es kaum erwarten, von dir zu hören._
     - _I’m really looking forward to seeing you! = Ich freue mich wirklich, dich zu sehen._
     - _Let me know if you need anything else. = Lass mich wissen, wenn du noch etwas brauchst._

- [ ] Skip a line before the closing.

- [ ] Does the email end with a **closing**, for example: 
    
    - _Bye for now,_
    - _See you soon,_
    - _Cheers,_
    - Common mistake: ~~Greetings,~~ is NOT an English closing.

- [ ] Did you **sign** (= _unterschrieben_) your email?
