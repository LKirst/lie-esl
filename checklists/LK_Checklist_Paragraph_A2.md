# Checklist: Writing a Body Paragraph (A2-B1, v.1.0.0)

In essay assignments, every body paragraph should have three parts:

- Beginning: The paragraph starts with a topic sentence (TS). The TS states the
__one claim__ (= *die Behauptung*) of the paragraph clearly.

- Middle: The supporting sentences support the topic sentences with
__explanation(s) and one or more examples__. Every supporting sentence should
clearly link to the topic sentence and not introduce new a new idea.

- End: The paragraph ends with a concluding sentence (CS). The CS summarizes
the main idea of the paragraph or makes a link to the next paragraph. 

After every paragraph, skip two more lines!
