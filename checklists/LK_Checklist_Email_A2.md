-   Does the email have a **subject line**, which summarizes the content of the
email in a few words? subject: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

    - Informal: _Hi XXX, / Hello (again) XXX,_
    
    - Formal: _Dear Mr. / Ms. YYY,_

-   Does the first line of the email body start with a **capital letter**?

-   Do you have an introduction? For your introduction, you can (a) thank your
recipient[^1] at the beginning of your email if you are replying to an email;
(b) ask your recipient how they are doing and tell them how you are (c)
introduce yourself if your recipient doesn't know you
    
    - Informal: _Thanks for your email. It's great to hear from you. / How are
    you? I'm happy that you've found friends at your new school. You'll have to
    introduce me to them when I come visit._

    - Formal: _My name is Joe Public. / Thank you for your prompt reply. /
    Thank you for contacting me._

-   Does the email **answer the questions** you were asked / fulfil the task
you were given?

-   Do you **provide enough details and examples**?

-   Do you end your email with (a question and) some friendly words:

    - Informal: _I can’t wait to hear from you. / I’m really looking forward to
    seeing you!_

    - Formal: _Thank you for your help / time / assistance. / I look forward to
    hearing from you soon / meeting you next Friday._
    
    - Both informal and formal: _Let me know if you need anything else._

-   Does the email end with a **closing**, for example:

    - Informal: _Bye for now, Best wishes, See you later,_ (you can only use
    this if you'll meet the recipient **in person** soon), _Cheers,_
    
    - Formal: _Yours sincerely, Kind regards, Regards,_
    
    - Common mistakes: *~~Greetings,~~* is NOT an English closing. Do NOT put
