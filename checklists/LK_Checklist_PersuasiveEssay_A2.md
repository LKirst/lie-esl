# Checklist: Persuasive Essay (A2, v1.2.0)

## Planning

- You made a writing plan. The plan includes notes (not full sentences) for
the introduction and the main body.

## Language

- You use a wide range of **grammatical structures** correctly. For
example:

    - conditional sentences: _If I were you, I'd ...; If you are interested in
    XXX, you'll ..._

    - relative clauses: _XXX, who / which ..., ...; the XYZ that ..._

    - questions

- You use a wide range of **vocabulary** correctly and you **paraphrase**
words you don't know. You don't use German.

    - strong adjectives and adverbs

    - comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs

    - interesting nouns

- You connect ideas with **transition words.** For example:

    - Effect and consequence: _as a result, then, because, ..._

    - Time and sequence: _as soon as, during, since, until, whenever, ..._

    - Compare and contrast: _like, similar to, compared to, although, as XXX as
    YYY, ..._

    - Examples: _for example, for instance, such as, another example of XXX is
    YYY, ...._

## Content

- The text has a **title,** which gives the reader a first idea of what the
text will be about and **catches their attention**. The title is underlined.

- Does the **introduction** hook the reader? For example with

    - a question

    - an anecdote[^1]

- Does the **introduction** end in a sentence, which tells the reader of
what the text will try to persuade them (**thesis statement**).

- Is the **main body** of the blog post divided into **paragraphs**. Every
paragraph presents only one idea.

- Does every **body paragraph** present **detailed reasons and examples**,
which help you **convince the reader of your argument**.

- Does the text have a **conclusion**?

    - Do you summarize your main arguments?

    - Often it is a good idea to end with a call to action (= ask the reader
    directly or indirectly to do something, such as recycle, donate to charity,
    sign a petition etc.)

For the structure of a paragraph, see also the [checklist for writing a
paragraph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link checklists/LK_Checklist_Paragraph_A2.md
%}).

## Form

- You give an estimate[^2] of the **word count**.

- You **skip every second line**, and you skip **two or more lines between
paragraphs**.

[^1]: anecdote: a short interesting or funny story about a real person or event

[^2]: estimate: Schätzung
