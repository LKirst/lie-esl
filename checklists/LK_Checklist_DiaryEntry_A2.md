# Checklist: Diary entry (A2, v1.1.2)

## The writing plan

- Does the plan include notes for the introduction (the beginning)?

- Do the notes include something that is likely to catch the readers attention,
for example an introduction which tells your diary why you're writing?

- Does the plan include a problem you (or the character whose diary entry
you're writing) faced? Are there notes for a (possible) solution to the
problem?

- Does the plan include notes for the end of the diary entry?

- Is the plan visually structured (beginning, middle, end)?

- **Time management:** Did you take not more than 5 min to make you plan? Did
you use bullet points instead of whole sentences to make the most of your
planning time?

## Diary entry

### Content

- The diary entry starts with the **date**, e.g. _28 March 2022_

- You use the salutation "**_Dear Diary,_**".

- You explain **why** you wrote the diary entry, and your story is
**interesting / funny / exciting / tragic**.

- You write about the events of the day. You explain **the situation(s)** in
detail, so that someone who wasn't there would understand what happened.

- You describe your **thoughts** and **feelings**!

- You end with a **closing sentence**, which shows the reader that they've
reached the end of the diary entry.

- You use the **writing prompt(s)** for your story (i.e. the information you
were given to tell you what you should write about)

- The diary entry ends **with a sign-off** and your **signature** in the next
line, e.g.:

  - sign-off: _Until tomorrow, / Yours,_

  - signature: _Jane_

### Structure

- You use paragraphs, and every **paragraph** is about **one idea or separate
part** of your story.

- You use several **time markers**, _e.g. this morning, as soon as, before,
immediately, while, since, ..._

- You join sentences with different **transition / linking words.**

### Language

- You use the **first person**.

- You use the **past tense** for finished events and actions in the past.

- You use different **adjectives and adverbs**.

- You use **descriptive nouns or verbs**.

- You use **different sentence structures**, e.g. rhetorical questions or
sentences with relative clauses.

- Bonus point: You use **similes**:

  - _as WWW as XXX_, e.g. _as white a snow_

  - _YYY like ZZZ_ e.g. _a face like a mask_

- The length of your diary entry is **above the minimum word** count.
