# Checklist: Informative Essay (A2, v1.1.1)

## Time

- [ ] You were able to finish writing the text in 20-25 min. 

## Planning

- [ ] You made a writing plan. The plan includes notes (not full sentences) for the introduction and the main body. 

## Language (60%)

- [ ] You did **not** use **first-person pronouns** (I / we).

- [ ] You did **not** use **contractions** (they've =\> they have; won't =\> will not; isn't =\> is not).

- [ ] Does the text connect ideas with **transition words**? For example: 

    - Compare and contrast: _like, similar to, compared to, although_; 
    - Examples: _for example, for instance, such as, Another example of XXX is YYY_;
    - To conclude: _in summary, to sum up, in conclusion, as a result_

- [ ] You use a wide range of **grammatical structures correctly.**

- [ ] You use a wide range of **vocabulary** correctly and you **paraphrase** words you don't know. You don't use German.

## Content (40%)

- [ ] The text has an informative **title**, which gives the reader a first idea of what the text will be about.

- [ ] The writing is **factual:** I didn't present opinions (_I think \..., ... is good / bad / cool ..._) or fiction, just facts.

- [ ] Does the **introduction** hook the reader, for example with an unusual detail or a question?

- [ ] Does the introduction end in a **thesis statement** (one sentence, which tells the reader the claim of the text)?

- [ ] Does the **main body** present subtopics with a new paragraph for every subtopic? (For most tasks you write in class, you will only have time for two subtopics.)

- [ ] Does every **body paragraph** start with a topic sentence. The topic sentence presents the main idea or claim of the paragraph in one sentence.

- [ ] Does every **body paragraph** present reasons (explanation) and examples to support the topic sentence (i.e. supporting sentences).

- [ ] Does the text have a **concluding paragraph**, which sums up the main points and restates the thesis statement in a new way?

- [ ] Does the text answer the question / fulfil the task you were given (= _beantwortet der Text die Frage / erfüllt der Text die Aufgabe die dir gegeben wurde_)?

## Form

- [ ] You included an estimate[^2] of the **word count**. 

- [ ] You **skip every second line**, and you skip **two or more lines between paragraphs**.
