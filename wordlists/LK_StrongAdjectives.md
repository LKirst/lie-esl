# Strong adjectives

## What are strong adjectives

Strong adjectives are adjectives with which we do not use _very_ because they
in themselves already have the meaning of _very_.

Here are some examples:

| very + adjective | strong adjectives                                         |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| very big         | enormous, huge, vast                                      |
| very small       | tiny                                                      |
