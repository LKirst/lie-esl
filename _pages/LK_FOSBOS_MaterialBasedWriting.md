This article is a work in progress. I will add to it over the next days.

## How to use the material

- Do not mention the author of a source and do not quote the material directly!
  There is one exception to this rule: If the material is a short quote, you
  may use it as a hook in your introduction. In that case you should reference
  the person you quote directly.

- If the material includes several numbers, do not just pick out one. Make sure
  you use the material in a way that shows you have understood the
  relationships it presents.

## FAQ

### How many arguments should I write?

I recommend using one of the three materials for the introduction and the
remaining two for two body paragraphs.

If for some reason you feel more comfortable using each material in a body
paragraph of its own, you can divide your main body into three paragraphs as
well. Just keep in mind that I expect you to have a topic sentence and
supporting sentences for every body paragraph.

### What is the difference between "Comment" and "Discuss"?

"Discuss ..." always means you have to present two different views on a topic.
"Comment ..." normally means you argue in one direction. However, if the
material lends itself more to presenting two different views on a topic, you
may treat a comment task the same way as a discussion task.

### Do I loose credits for writing too much or too little?

You will not lose credits for writing too much but you will lose credits for
falling significantly below the minimum word count of 300 words.
