## The writing plan

Does your plan include notes for the introduction?

Does your plan include notes for the body of your text? You should have **at
least two body paragraphs (one for each side of the issue)**. For every
paragraph, you should have notes for ...

- the main argument of the paragraph

- supporting evidence in the form of facts, quotations, statistics, or examples

**Form:** Is the plan visually structured into the introduction and the body
paragraphs? Did you use bullet points instead of whole sentences to make the
most of your planning time?

## Form

- The length of your text is **above the minimum word** count.

- You **skip every second line**, and you skip **two or more lines between
  paragraphs**.

## Content and Structure

Content

- Your essay has a descriptive **heading.** (Not relevant for FOSBOS students.)

- Does your introduction ...

  catch the reader's attention (with a hook)

  briefly explain the issue

  for **FOSBOS** students: ... lead up to a paraphrase
  of the essay question as a direct or indirect question

  for **everyone else**: ... lead up to a thesis statement, which sums up your
  opinion about the subject on which you were asked

- You present **two perspectives on an issue with compelling[^1] arguments**
  and answer the question you were asked / **fulfil the task you were given**.
  The simplest structure of a discussion essay with two body paragraphs is:

  Body paragraph 1: the view you don't agree with

  Body paragraph 2: the view you agree with

- You support both perspectives with **detailed explanations** and
  **evidence**. Depending on your task, you rebut[^2] reasons for
  the perspective you do not agree with.

Structure

- The **introduction** leads up to and presents a **concise thesis statement**
  (for **FOSBOS** students: the paraphrase of the essay question). The introduction
  introduces the topic briefly in general terms. It should be **approximately
  10-20% of your word count**.

- You divide your text into **paragraphs**, and for every body paragraph, the
  **topic sentence** (first sentence of the paragraph) presents **one claim**,
  related to the thesis statement / essay question.

- The **supporting sentences** of every body paragraph support the topic
  sentences and do not introduce new ideas.

- The arguments which you agree with less come first. Your later body
  paragraphs should be longer since you will want to go into more detail for
  your strongest arguments.

- The comment ends in a **concluding paragraph**, which sums up the main points
  and restates the thesis statement in a new way. The conclusion does not
  present new arguments.

### Language

- You use a wide range of **sentence structures correctly**, e.g. conditional
  sentences, relative clauses, and subordinate clauses.

- You show a good command of a **broad lexical repertoire**. You can vary[^3]
  formulation to avoid frequent repetition[^4] and you find **paraphrases**
  when you do not know a word you need. You make few spelling mistakes.

- You use the **correct tenses**. Generally, the present tense is used in
  essays unless you talk about events in the past.

- You connect ideas with **different linking / transition words**, including
  different subordinating conjunctions (e.g. *although, wherever, so that,
  \...*) and adverbial conjunctions (e.g. *however, nevertheless, meanwhile,
  \...*).

- Register: You use formal language. You do **not use contractions** (*they've
  =\> they have; won't =\> will not; isn't =\> is not*) and you use **no slang
  or colloquialisms**.
