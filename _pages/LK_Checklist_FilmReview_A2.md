## Content

- Does the review have a **descriptive** heading? (_Review_ on its own is not a
descriptive heading.)

- Does your review have a clear structure? Is it divided into paragraphs, where
each **paragraph** deals with one idea?

- First paragraph:

  - Does the first paragraph contain your brief[^brief] overall opinion of the
    film (in two to three sentences)?

  - Does the first paragraph give some basic facts like the title of the film
    (underlined), the names of the actors and the year of release[^release]?

- Second paragraph:

  - Do you provide a **short** summary of the plot.

  - Do you provide enough detail so your reader knows what the film is about
    but not give away[^giveaway] the ending.

- Third paragraph (the **most important part** of your review!):

  - Do you **give your opinion** and **explain** it?

  - Do you give concrete examples from the film when you present your opinion?

  - Do you consider **different aspects** (i.e. two or more), such as acting,
    the music and sound effects, special effects, how well the dialogue is
    written, how entertaining the plot is ...

- Final paragraph:

  - The final paragraph should include your recommendation(s)[^recommendation].
  You can suggest who the film would most appeal[^appealto] to.

  - Did you give reasons for your recommendations.

## Language

Hint: The language criteria are very similar to the criteria for a persuasive
text.

- You use a wide range of **grammatical structures** correctly. For example:

  - conditional sentences: _If I were you, I'd ...; If you are interested in
  XXX, you'll ..._

  - relative clauses: _XXX, who / which ..., ...; the XYZ that ..._

  - questions

- You use the correct tenses. For summaries, we generally use the **present
simple**.

- You use a wide range of **vocabulary** correctly and you **paraphrase** words
you don't know. You don't use German.

  - strong **adjectives and adverbs**

  - comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs

  - interesting nouns

- You connect ideas with **transition words.** For example:

  - Effect and consequence: _as a result, then, because, ..._

  - Time and sequence: _as soon as, during, since, until, whenever, ..._

  - Compare and contrast: _like, similar to, compared to, although, as XXX as
  YYY, ..._

  - Examples: _for example, for instance, such as, another example of XXX is
  YYY, ...._
