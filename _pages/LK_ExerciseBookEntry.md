title: Structure of an exercise book entry

Every exercise book entry should follow the same pattern:

- Write the **date in the margin** in the format *1st April*

- Choose a descriptive **heading**: *Homework* or *Email* are NOT descriptive
headings. A heading should make clear what the exercise book entry is about and
what makes it different from other entries. In most cases, you can use the
heading of your task from the textbook, workbook or worksheet.

- **Underline** your heading with a ruler.

- Skip a line after the heading before you start writing.

- For text productions (not for grammar or vocabulary exercises), please **skip
every second line** within a paragraph and skip two or more lines between
paragraphs.

- After your exercise book entry before the next entry, please skip at least
three lines.
