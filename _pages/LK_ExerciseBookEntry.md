# Structure of an exercise book entry

Every exercise book entry should follow the same pattern:

- Write the date in the margin in the format *1st April*

- Choose a descriptive heading: *Homework* or *Email* are NOT descriptive
headings. A heading should make clear what the exercise book entry is about and
what makes it different from other entries. In most cases, you can use the
heading of your task from the textbook, workbook or worksheet.

- Underline your heading.

- For text productions (not for grammar or vocabulary exercises): Please skip
every second line within a paragraph and skip two or more lines between
paragraphs.

- Skip a line after the heading before you start writing.

- After your exercise book entry before the next entry, please skip at least
three lines.
