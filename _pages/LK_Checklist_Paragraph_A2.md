title: 'Writing a Body Paragraph'
---

In essay assignments, every body paragraph should have three parts:

- Beginning: The paragraph starts with a topic sentence (TS). The TS states the
  __one claim__ (= *die Behauptung*) of the paragraph clearly.
 
  A TS is (part of) the answer to the question that you try to answer with your
  essay.

  Keep your TS concise. Do not include supporting information such as examples
  or statistics.

- Middle: The supporting sentences should support the TS with __explanation and
  one or more examples__. Every supporting sentence should clearly relate to
  the TS and should not introduce a new idea.

- End: The paragraph ends with a concluding sentence (CS). The CS summarizes
  the main idea of the paragraph or links to the next paragraph.

After every paragraph, skip two more lines!
