## Thesis statement

If you attend a **Fachoberschule or a Berufsoberschule** in Bavaria, please skip to
the [end of this post](#fosbos-essayquestion).
{: .notice--warning}

An introduction should make your reader interested in the topic of the text and
lead up to a thesis statement. The most important sentence of your introduction
is the thesis statement at the end of your introduction.

Before you read this post, please read the post [*Writing a Body
Paragraph*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/LK_Checklist_Paragraph_A2.md %}).
If you know how to write a body paragraph, you will know that every body
paragraph starts with a topic sentence. The thesis statement is for your entire
text what your topic sentence is for one body paragraph. A thesis statement
presents the main idea of your essay.

A strong thesis statement states **one main idea of your text**. This idea can have
**subtopics** which you then develop in different body paragraphs, but you should
not present two unrelated ideas in one thesis statement.

Here are some examples:

1. Example: *The German government should take measures to prevent the adverse
   effects of sugary drinks on public health by introducing a sugar tax and
   warning labels.* 

   - Subtopic 1 (topic sentence of the first body paragraph): *The government
     should proactively address the health concerns related to the
     consumption of sugary drinks by introducing a sugar tax*.
 
   - Subtopic 2 (topic sentence of the second body paragraph): *The incidence of
     diseases related to a diet high in sugar could be reduced if the government
     introduced warning labels on sugary drinks.*
 
2. Example: *The platform and financial resources which sports superstars
   have amplify their impact as role models, both positively and negatively.*

   - Subtopic 1 (topic sentence of the first body paragraph): *If athletes
     choose to use their position of power to demonstrate integrity and give
     back to their community, they can serve as positive role models.*
  
   - Subtopic 2 (topic sentence of the second body paragraph): *If sports
     superstars abuse their privileged position, they set a very visible bad
     example for their fans.* 

3. Example: *While some argue that the juvenile justice system should prioritize
   punishment as a deterrent, others contend that sentences focussed on
   rehabilitation are more effective at reducing juvenile delinquency.*

   - Subtopic 1 (topic sentence of the first body paragraph): *Punishment can
     deter young people from committing crimes by showing them that criminal
     behaviour has negative consequences for them.*

   - Subtopic 2 (topic sentence of the second body paragraph): *While punishment
     may make crime less attractive, rehabilitation is more effective because
     it teaches young offenders alternative behaviour.*

A strong thesis statement **should not be too general**. If a thesis statement
is too broad, you can not sufficiently support it in the main body and your
reader cannot tell from your thesis statement what your essay will be about.

## Fachoberschule / Berufsoberschule {#fosbos-essayquestion}

If you attend a Fachoberschule or a Berufsoberschule, you should **not** end
your introduction with a thesis statement, but rather with a **paraphrase of
the topic of your essay as a direct or indirect question**.

Here are some phrases you can use to introduce the question:

- ..., which **raises the question** as to whether ...

- That is why **the question arises** whether ...

- The contrast between ... and ... **prompts the question** ... / This prompts the question ...

- **Faced with** ..., we are **have to ask** ...

Punctuation: Remember that indirect questions embedded in declarative sentences
take a full stop, **not a question mark**.

Examples: 

- Task: Write a comment on whether sugary drinks should have warning labels and
  higher taxes.

  End of the introduction: *The adverse health effects of a diet high in sugar
  prompt the question of whether Germany should put a tax on sugary drinks and
  require warning labels on such beverages.*

- Task: Discuss whether sports superstars are suitable role models for young
  people.

  End of the introduction: *Prominent examples of athletes falling short of the
  high standards we set for role models raise the question to what extent
  children and adolescents should look to athletes for guidance and
  inspiration.*

- Task: Discuss whether the juvenile justice system should focus on
  rehabilitation over punishment.

  End of the introduction: *There is a high rate of young offenders in the U.S.
  who are rearrested within three years of their release from incarceration.
  That is why the question arises of whether it may be more important to
  rehabilitate juvenile delinquents than to punish them.*
