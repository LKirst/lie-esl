title: 'Writing a Thesis Statement'
---

An introduction should make your reader interested in the topic of the text and
lead up to a thesis statement. The most important sentence of your introduction
is the thesis statement at the end of your introduction.

Before you read this post, please read the post [*Writing a Body
Paragraph*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/LK_Checklist_Paragraph_A2.md %}).
If you know how to write a body paragraph, you will know that every body
paragraph starts with a topic sentence. The thesis statement is for your entire
text what your topic sentence is for one body paragraph. A thesis statement
presents the main idea of your essay.

A strong thesis statement states **one main idea**. This idea can have
subtopics which you then develop in different body paragraphs but you should
not present two separate ideas in one thesis statement.

1. Example: *The German government should take measures to prevent the adverse
   effects of sugary drinks on public health by introducing a sugar tax and
   warning labels.* 

   - Subtopic 1 (topic sentence of the first body paragraph): *The government
     should proactively address the health concerns related to the the
     consumption of sugary drinks by introducing a sugar tax*.
 
   - Subtopic 2 (topic sentence of the second body paragraph): *The incidence of
     diseases related to a diet high in sugar could be reduced if the government
     introced warning labels on sugary drinks.*
 
2. Example: *The platform and and financial resources which sports superstars
   have amplify their impact as role models, both positively and negatively.*

   - Subtopic 1 (topic sentence of the first body paragraph): *If athletes
     choose to use their position of power to demonstrate integrity and give
     back to their community, they can serve as positive role models.*
  
   - Subtopic 2 (topic sentence of the second body paragraph): *If sports
     superstars abuse their priviliged position, they set a very visible bad
     example for their fans.* 

A strong thesis statement should not be **too general**. If a thesis statement
is too broad, you can not sufficiently support it in the main body and your
reader cannot tell from your thesis statement what your essay will be about.
