title: 'Writing an Essay Hook'
---

Your introduction should lead up to and end in a topic sentence or essay
question. This post is specifically designed for students at FOSBOS in Bavaria,
who are expected to conclude their introductions with a well-formulated essay
question.

You should start your introduction with an **essay hook**. A hook is typically
the first one to three sentences of your introduction that catch the reader's
attention and compels them to continue reading.

Your essay hook should **NOT provide an answer to your essay question** before
it has been posed. The hook should rather make your reader ask the essay
question before you ask it or it should make clear why trying to answer your
essay question would be worthwile.

The **transition from your hook to the essay question** is important. Often
students write "This raises the question of whether ..." when it is not clear
how the essay question follows from the essay hook. When crafting your hook,
ensure you understand how it connects to the essay question, and articulate
that connection clearly.

Here are several types of essay hooks you might consider using:

1. (**Rhetorical Questions**: Pose a thought-provoking question to
   engage the reader. I recommend using this type of hook with caution. If you
   start with a rhetorical question, you may end up presenting two questions in
   a row - first the hook, then the essay question â€” which can disrupt the flow of
   your introduction.)

2. **Fact/Statistic**: Present a surprising fact or statistic.

3. **Quote**: Use a relevant quote from a notable figure.

4. **Anecdote**: Share a brief personal story or experience.

5. **Description**: Paint a vivid picture of a scene or situation.

6. **Common Misconception**: Address a widely held belief that you intend to
   challenge in your essay.
