title: 'Writing an Essay Hook for an MBW'
---

Your introduction should lead up to, and end with, a topic sentence or essay
question. This post is specifically designed for students at FOSBOS in Bavaria,
who are expected to conclude the introduction to a material-based writing (MBW)
assignment with a well‑formulated essay question.

You should begin your introduction with an essay hook. A hook is usually the
first one to three sentences of your introduction and is intended to catch the
reader’s attention and encourage them to continue reading.

Your essay hook should not provide an answer to your essay question before you
have even posed it. Instead, it should prompt the reader to consider the
question themselves or make clear why attempting to answer it is worthwhile.

The transition from your hook to the essay question is important. Students
often write “This raises the question of whether …” even though it is not clear
how the question follows from the hook. When crafting your hook, make sure you
understand how it connects to the essay question, and express this connection
clearly.

Here are several types of essay hooks you might consider using:

1. Fact/Statistic: Present a surprising fact or statistic. This grounds your
   essay in data. The statistic may come from one of the materials or from
facts you have memorised during your exam preparation (for example by reading
the textbook).

2. Quote: Use a relevant quote from a notable figure. This type of hook adds
   authority to your essay and links it to a wider discussion. If you use a
quote from the material, always explain it.

3. Common misconception: Address a widely held belief that you intend to
   challenge in your essay.

4. Explanation of the topic’s relevance: If none of the options above work for
   you, you can always explain why the topic of the essay matters.

In a material-based writing essay at FOSBOS, you should not use first-person
pronouns in your introduction (e.g. I, you, we). Therefore, anecdotes are not
suitable as hooks in an MBW introduction.

It may be sensible to plan your entire essay, including the introduction,
before you start writing. However, you might decide to write the main body
first and return to the introduction once you have finalised your body
paragraphs.

For the last sentence of your introduction, see the [checklist for writing
a paraphrase of the essay question]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
