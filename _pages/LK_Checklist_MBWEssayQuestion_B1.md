If you attend a Fachoberschule or a Berufsoberschule, you should **not** end
your introduction with a **paraphrase of
the topic of your essay as a direct or indirect question**.

Here are some phrases you can use to introduce the question:

- ..., which **raises the question** as to whether ...

- That is why **the question arises** whether ...

- The contrast between ... and ... **prompts the question** ... / This prompts the question ...

- **Faced with** ..., we are **have to ask** ...

Punctuation: Remember that indirect questions embedded in declarative sentences
take a full stop, **not a question mark**.

Please pay attention to the spelling in the examples above: *raise* is not the
same as *arise*.
{: .notice--warning}

Examples:

- Task: Write a comment on whether sugary drinks should have warning labels and
  higher taxes.

  End of the introduction: *The adverse health effects of a diet high in sugar
  prompt the question of whether Germany should put a tax on sugary drinks and
  require warning labels on such beverages.*

- Task: Discuss whether sports superstars are suitable role models for young
  people.

  End of the introduction: *Prominent examples of athletes falling short of the
  high standards we set for role models raise the question to what extent
  children and adolescents should look to athletes for guidance and
  inspiration.*

- Task: Discuss whether the juvenile justice system should focus on
  rehabilitation over punishment.

  End of the introduction: *There is a high rate of young offenders in the U.S.
  who are rearrested within three years of their release from incarceration.
  That is why the question arises of whether it may be more important to
  rehabilitate juvenile delinquents than to punish them.*
