title: 'Stating the topic of an MBW essay (FOSBOS)'
toc: true
---

If you attend a Fachoberschule or a Berufsoberschule, you should **not** end
the introduction with a **paraphrase of
the topic of your essay as a direct or indirect question**.

Here are some phrases you can use to introduce the essay question in an MBW introduction:

- ..., which **raises the question** of whether ...

- That is why **the question arises** of whether ...

- The contrast between ... and ... **prompts the question** ... / This prompts the question ...

Please pay attention to the spelling in the examples above: *raise* is not the
same as *arise*.
{: .notice--warning}

Punctuation and grammar: Remember that indirect questions embedded in
declarative sentences end with a full stop, **not a question mark**. Moreover, note
that in indirect questions, subject and verb no longer invert. Here are some
examples (which do not use paraphrases to show the grammatical change):

- What can{: style:"color: red"} schools{: style:"color: blue"} do to minimise
their students' screen time at school? > This raises the question of what
schools{: style:"color: blue"} can{: style:"color: red"} do to minimise their
students' screen time at school.
- Should{: style:"color: red"} schools{: style:"color: blue"} try to minimise
their students' screen time at school? > That is why the question arises of
whether schools{: style:"color: blue"} should{: style:"color: red"} try to
minimise their students' screen time at school.

Examples:

- Task: Write a comment on whether sugary drinks should have warning labels and
higher taxes.

  End of the introduction: *The adverse health effects of a diet high in sugar
  prompt the question of whether Germany should introduce a tax on sugary drinks and
  require warning labels on these beverages.*

- Task: Discuss whether sports superstars are suitable role models for young
people.

  End of the introduction: *Prominent examples of athletes' questionable
  behaviour raise the question of to what extent children and adolescents should
  look to athletes for guidance and inspiration.*

- Task: Discuss whether the juvenile justice system should focus on
rehabilitation over punishment.

  End of the introduction: *There is a high rate of young offenders in the U.S.
  who are re-arrested within three years of their release from incarceration.
  That is why the question arises of whether it may be more important to
  rehabilitate juvenile delinquents than to punish them.*
